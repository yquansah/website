## The New Format

The 2025-26 Champions League continues with the revamped league phase format. With 36 teams competing in a single table, the race for knockout qualification has been more unpredictable than ever.

## Teams to Watch

A few clubs have stood out so far:

- **Real Madrid** — The defending champions never make it easy, but they always seem to find a way when it matters most.
- **Manchester City** — With their depth of squad, they remain one of the favorites to go deep in the tournament.
- **Barcelona** — A rejuvenated squad has been playing some of the most exciting football in Europe this season.

## Key Matchups

The draw for the knockout rounds always produces drama. This year is no different, with several mouth-watering ties on the horizon.

What makes the Champions League special is its ability to produce unforgettable moments — last-minute goals, underdog runs, and individual performances that define careers.

## My Prediction

It's always risky to predict a winner this early, but I'll go out on a limb: keep an eye on the teams that peak at the right time rather than the ones dominating the league phase. History shows that form in February and March matters more than form in September.

The knockout rounds are where legends are made. I can't wait.
